This repo was made watching to [Programming Dimension's videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvpbDCl_H7mfgmEJPl1bTHlH5g-f0kWDM&si=5_MpyIIuhunfV2Qp).  
The idea was to learn more about Assembly while coding something.

I really don't know how they were patient to create DOOM with this.

What I learned:
- MASM
- 8-bits registers
- Maybe Unix was better
- Alignment of instructions
